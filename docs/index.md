#Description 

Super Soukoban is a Puzzle game, developed by Thinking Rabbit and published by Pack-In-Video, which was released in Japan in 1993.

The objective of the game is to push crates or boxes around a maze and put them in their designated storage area, marked by a pink dot, using logic since there is a maximum amount of steps per level that the players can take. The goal of all these tasks is to save up enough money to buy a new fancy car and impress the girl he likes, who unfortunately goes off with a guy in a nicer car.
